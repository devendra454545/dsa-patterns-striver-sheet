# DSA Pattern Practice in Python (Patterns 1–18)

This repository contains the pattern problems I practiced while learning Data Structures and improving my logic building skills.

These patterns are inspired by Striver’s TUF DSA Sheet and are very helpful for understanding how nested loops, numbers, characters, and spacing work together to form different shapes and sequences.

I implemented all of these using Python to strengthen my fundamentals.

## What you will find here

You will see different types of patterns such as:

* Star patterns (square, triangle, pyramid, diamond)
* Number patterns (increasing, decreasing, palindrome, continuous)
* Alphabet patterns (triangle, reverse, repeated, palindrome)

Each pattern is written as a separate function so it’s easy to run and understand.

## Why I practiced these patterns

These problems helped me:

* Improve my thinking with nested loops
* Understand pattern logic clearly
* Get comfortable with ASCII characters and number sequences
* Build confidence for DSA and coding interviews

## How to run the code

Make sure Python is installed, then run the file and call any function:

```python
p7(5)    # Pyramid star pattern
p17(4)   # Alphabet palindrome pyramid
```

## Source of practice

These patterns are based on the pattern section from Striver’s TUF DSA Sheet.

I will keep adding more patterns (19–22 next) as I continue practicing.
